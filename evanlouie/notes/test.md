Task Examples
=============

Task 1: Livechat
----------------
Evan is a CS344 student who wants to have hold a group chat meeting on Connect. Evan logs into Connect and goes into the CS344 course and in clicks on the "Host Livechat" link located in the left submenu.  A user invite screen is shown to Evan and he sees a list of currently enrolled CS344 students.  Evan checks off the to all the users invited that they have been added to a IRC livechat.  Evan can post in the chat which will persist and be shown to all users when they login; even if not currently. If Evan logs off and then re logs-in, he will be greeted with the option to view existing livechats or to create a new one. The users which Evan checked off to include in the livechat will receive a notification that they have been invited to a livechat via email or sms depending on the alert functionality the user has specified. In the livechat, users can upload files to share amongst invited users, make private messages to users as well as invite new members. 

Discussion: This use case contains general IRC functionality with automated user information made available from Connect. Potential email/sms notifications are going to be essential for users to get the most up to date alerts that something has been posted. Potentially their should be an 'alert' function in the chat to send out and alert to users.

Analysis: As of right now, no livechat style functionality exists within Connect; with the closest thing possbile being making public forum threads which cannot be hidden from others.  The existing UI for selecting users to send emails to would be quite adiquate for choosing users to include in the chat.  Although this functionality should be made visable from the course page and not just the Connect homepage.  Their does currently already exist functionality to alert users via email that a forum thread has been updated if that user is subscribed to said thread; we can migrate this funtionality over to livechats.  

Task 2: Emailing
-----------------
Henry, a first year UBC student from the faculty of Arts, is taking a course in Geography and is assigned to a team project with 5 other students.  Henry does not know who his teammates are.  He logs into UBC connect to try to see if the professor has posted some information regarding the teams.  Henry is eager to get started on the project and would like to set up a draft email to the specific teammates of his once he knows their names.  In the email, Henry thought it would be a fun idea to add the latest 5-minute Youtube video he made about a mixed pop music to let the other team members get to know the cool him a little better.  Also, he would like to create a poll on where to meet up for the first time.  Not knowing what his teammates looks like, Henry requested if all of them could upload a picture to their Connect profile or attach a recent photo in the email.  Henry, with his artsy mind and creative thoughts, use illustrator to create an awesome team logo and would like to attach the illustrator file (.ai) so that other team members can download it and modify it if they want to.

Discussion: This task contains email functionality activities, which deal with a draft email that can be later on send out very quickly.  The email feature should also include attachment for different file formats.  Potentially a in-email poll creation is desirable, though not necessary.  This task should be done very smoothly with good matching between the Connect emailing system and the real world.


Task 3: Batch Download
-----------------------
Matt, a Computer Science student, is enrolled in CPSC 311 where the professor uploads the notes for every lecture to Connect. Matt wants to download lecture notes for the course from the past two weeks. He logs in to Connect and clicks on the Lecture Notes section. He clicks on the CPSC 311 dropdown and sees that there are 5 pdf files that he needs to download. He wants to download all of them, so he selects the checkboxes beside the five lecture notes and clicks download. He gets all 5 pdf files in a zip file. 

Discussion: The activity for Matt involves downloading the lecture notes. He should be able to download multiple sets of notes in an efficient manner, rather than having to download them one by one. This is an important and frequently done task.
